### INTRODUCTION.
  I'm a licensed science teacher who has transitioned into a technology professional, specializing in SOC analyst with solid foundations in IT SUPPORT.  I am passionate about leveraging my educational background,  detail-oriented technical expertise, and troubleshooting in Cybersecurity to drive innovation, tackle complex challenges, and support organizations in achieving a standardized security posture.

###  OBJECTIVE
My journey in IT Support and teaching has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. Several skills in analytical thinking, troubleshooting, problem-solving, paying attention to details, and clear communication skills that I have honed throughout my years of teaching complex scientific concepts. I'm currently exploring the dynamic field of cybersecurity with a particular interest in network security, vulnerability assessment, gap analysis, and asset security. I‚Äôm particularly interested in the role of a SOC Analyst, where I can apply and expand my skills in:
- üîç Threat Detection & Incident Response
- üß† Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools
- üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) & Firewalls
- üìä Log Analysis & Forensics
- üîÑ Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- üß© Critical Thinking & Pattern Recognition
- üìö Continuous Learning & Adaptability.
  
My goal is to contribute meaningfully to security teams and projects by combining my passion for cybersecurity with a commitment to lifelong learning and operational excellence.

### SKILL
| **SKILLS**                | **ASSOCIATED PROJECTS** |
| -----------------------|---------------------|
|Python programminglanguage|  created keylodger with python |
| Linux command, SQL | deployed security tools on Ubuntu and Kali, used SQL to query the database for suspicious login attempts |
|SIEM tools | I deployed Wazuh on a Windows machine and simulated different attacks to see how the events are logged, and I also deployed Splunk in a simulated organization's Active Directory, with one of the machines on the Active Directory being attacked to see how Splunk logged it|
|Network Analysis | I used Wireshark to capture network traffic on a simulated organization network to detect a brute-force attack with indicators like unusual traffic patterns, repeated failed login attempts from the same or multiple IP addresses, and I also analyzed PCAPs of real-world attacks.|
|Vulnerability Scanning | I use Nessus vulnerability scanning  to scan Windows and Linux OS for malware, and also web applications for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, and XSS | 
|Security Framework| I use AtomicRed Team to simulate an attack on a Windows machine to see how to configure HIDS logs it which helps me understand MITRE ATT&CK techniques.|
|Security framework | I created a network topography that ensures a standardized security posture with the ISO 27001 security framework, which ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability.|
| Incident response | I created an incident response playbook that simulates how an organization should handle some common security threats like ransomware, phishing breach, and insider threat, DDoS Attacks, and Malware following the NIST SP 800-61 framework
|transferable skills | Troubleshooting technical issues, clear communication from my teaching career, paying attention to detail, and calmness when solving challenging issues|
| Logs analysis | I perform alert triage when querying logs on Splunk to check for IOC |
